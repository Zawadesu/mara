# Welcome to MARA!
## About MARA
MARA(Metabolism of Arachidonic acid along Ageing) is a Python-based model for the prediction of expression level changes of the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway related genes 
along ageing.

## Introduction
MARA is a Python-based model composed of genetic programming method and neural network frameworks, which is at a start point to explore metabolite network modeling methods. With
simply setting the work direction and inputting the age information, the model is able to return a result where the user may get the expression level of arachidonic acid pathway 
genes at their age.

The overall flow chart of how MARA works is shown below.
